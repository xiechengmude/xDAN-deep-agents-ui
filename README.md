# Deep Agents UI

Deep Agents are generic AI agents that are capable of handling tasks of varying complexity. This is a UI intended to be used alongside the [`deep-agents`](https://github.com/hwchase17/deepagents?ref=blog.langchain.com) package from LangChain.

### Connecting to a Local LangGraph Server

Create a `.env.local` file and set two variables

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_URL="http://127.0.0.1:2024" # Or your server URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_ID=<your agent ID from langgraph.json>
```

### Connecting to a Production LangGraph Deployment on LGP

Create a `.env.local` file and set three variables

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEPLOYMENT_URL="your agent server URL"
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_ID=<your agent ID from langgraph.json>
NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<langsmith-api-key>
```



Once you have your environment variables set, install all dependencies and run your app.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to test out your deep agent!
